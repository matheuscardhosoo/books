## Chapter 1. Why NoSQL?

### 1.1. The Value of Relational Databases

- **Persistent data**: when compared to file systems, relational databases provide a much more flexible and powerful way to store and query data.
- **Concurrency**: relational databases provide manage concurrency and provide transactional guarantees.
- **Inter-application Integration**: data can be shared between applications using a common database or syncing data between databases.
- **A Mostly Standard Model**: the relational model is a standard model that is implemented by many vendors.

### 1.2. Impedance Mismatch

- **Object-Relational Impedance Mismatch**: the difference between the relational model and the in-memory data structures of the programming language.
- The relational model is organized around relations (tables) and tuples (rows).
  - A tuple is a set of name-value pairs.
    - Values in tuples have to be simple (e.g. no nested objects, no arrays, etc.)
  - A relation is a set of tuples with the same set of attributes.
  - All operations are performed on relations (which leads to a mathematically relational algebra).
- On the other hand, the in-memory data structures of the programming language are organized around objects identified by its memory address.
- This foundational difference leads to a mismatch between the relational model and the in-memory data structures of the programming language.
- This mismatch leads to a lot of boilerplate code to map between the relational model and the in-memory data structures of the programming language. Furthermore, the abstractions can become a problem of their own when people try too hard to ignore the database and query performance suffers.

### 1.3. Application and Integration Databases

- **Integration Database**: a database that is used by multiple applications.
  - A big  reason for the success of relational databases during the 80s and 90s was the need for integration databases. The relational model was a good fit for this use case because it provided a standard model that could be used by multiple applications in a consistent way.
  - But, this approach has its own problems:
    - **Data/Schema Integration**: the data/schema of the database has to be designed to support all the applications that use it. This leads to a lot of compromises and a lot of unused data.
    - **Performance**: the database has to be tuned to support all the applications that use it. This leads to a lot of compromises and performance problems.
- **Application Database**: a database that is used by a single application.
  - This approach is much more common today because it avoids the problems of integration databases, bringing the focus back to the application and giving more flexibility to the database choice.
  - It's only possible because of the rise of the web protocols and the fact that most applications are now accessed through APIs. This makes it possible to have multiple applications with their own databases that share data through their APIs.
    - This approach is called **Service-Oriented Architecture** (SOA) and deals with different integration problems than the integration databases (like consistency along distributed data, availability, etc.).
    - In a first moment, this approach was executed by separating the application into two parts **Presentation Tier** and **Business Data Tier** which communicate each other using the HTTP protocol to exchange data in a format like XML or JSON.
      - This provided more flexibility for the structure of the data that was being exchanged between the two tiers.

### 1.4. Attack of the Clusters

- **Cluster**: a group of computers that work together to provide a single service.
1. **Dot-com boom**: the early 2000s saw the burst of the 1990s dot-com bubble, leading to questions about the economic future of the Internet.
2. **Increase in Web Scale**: Despite the dot-com bubble burst, the 2000s saw a dramatic increase in the scale of web properties. Websites began tracking activity and structure in detail, leading to large sets of data.
3. **Growth in Data and Users**: The growth in data was accompanied by a growth in users, requiring more computing resources.
4. **Scaling Up vs Scaling Out**: To handle the increase in data and traffic, two options were available: scaling up (bigger machines, more processors, disk storage, and memory) or scaling out (using lots of small machines in a cluster).
5. **Clusters and Relational Databases**: As large properties moved towards clusters, it revealed that relational databases are not designed to be run on clusters. This led to technical issues and increased licensing costs.
6. **Google and Amazon's Influence**: Google and Amazon, both capturing huge amounts of data and running large clusters, considered alternative routes to data storage. They produced influential papers about their efforts: BigTable from Google and Dynamo from Amazon.
   - **BigTable**: a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers.
   - **Dynamo**: a highly available key-value storage system that some of Amazon's core services use to provide an "always-on" experience.
7. **New Databases for Clusters**: As more information about what Google and Amazon had done became available, people began to explore creating databases designed to live in a world of clusters, posing a serious threat to the dominance of relational databases.

### 1.5. The Emergence of NoSQL

- **Origin of the term NoSQL**: The term "NoSQL" first appeared in the late 90s as the name of an open-source relational database. The current usage of "NoSQL" that we recognize today traces back to a meetup on June 11, 2009 in San Francisco.
- **Definition of NoSQL**: NoSQL has never had a strong definition. Common characteristics of databases that tend to be called "NoSQL" include the absence of SQL, most are open-source projects, are oriented to operate on clusters, operate without a schema, and are based on the needs of the early 21st century web properties.
- **Interpretation of the term NoSQL**: Most people who talk about NoSQL say that it really means "Not Only SQL". However, this interpretation has some problems.
- **Contribution of NoSQL**: The most important contribution of NoSQL is opening up the range of options for data storage. This is often referred to as polyglot persistence - using different data stores in different circumstances.
- **Use of NoSQL**: Organizations need to shift from integration databases to application databases. NoSQL is seen as a good choice for application databases.
- **Reasons to consider NoSQL**: The two main reasons for considering NoSQL are to handle data access with sizes and performance that demand a cluster and to improve the productivity of application development by using a more convenient data interaction style.

### 1.6. Key Points

- Relational databases have been a successful technology for twenty years, providing persistence, concurrency control, and an integration mechanism.
- Application developers have been frustrated with the impedance mismatch between the relational model and the in-memory data structures.
- There is a movement away from using databases as integration points towards encapsulating databases within applications and integrating through services.
- The vital factor for a change in data storage was the need to support large volumes of data by running on clusters. Relational databases are not designed to run efficiently on clusters.
- NoSQL is an accidental neologism. There is no prescriptive definitionâ€” all you can make is an observation of common characteristics.
- The common characteristics of NoSQL databases are - Not using the relational model
  - Running well on clusters
  - Open-source
  - Built for the 21st century web estates
  - Schemaless
  - The most important result of the rise of NoSQL is Polyglot Persistence.
